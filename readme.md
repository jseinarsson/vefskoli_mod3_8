# Javascript In The Browser - DOM Manipulation & Timing

[See the site live here](http://)

1. This site has a pseudo loading screen using CSS animations & setTimeout() in JS to delay the reveal of the main section for 10.5 seconds. Ideally, the loading of the page would control the CSS animation, but I decided to fake it for the purpose of this project, especially since the loading time won't be very long.

2. The Dashboard is revealed once the setTimeout counter runs out.
